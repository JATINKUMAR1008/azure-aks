# React Application CI/CD Pipeline with AKS and Terraform

This repository contains the code and configurations for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to deploy a React application on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, ensuring a streamlined and automated deployment process.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **modules/ServicePrincipal/**: Contains Terraform modules related to service principal creation and management, essential for secure access to Azure resources.

- **public/**: Holds publicly accessible static files, such as images and other assets used by the React application.

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the React application, including components, pages, and other frontend logic.

- **.env**: Environment variables required for both development and deployment processes.

- **.eslintrc.json**: Configuration file for ESLint, ensuring code quality and consistency across the project.

- **.gitattributes**: Git configuration file that manages attributes for path-specific settings.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git, such as node_modules and environment files.

- **.terraform.lock.hcl**: Lock file generated by Terraform, ensuring consistent infrastructure provisioning by locking provider versions.

- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image build process for the React application, enabling containerization.

- **Jenkinsfile**: Contains the Jenkins pipeline configuration, automating the build, test, and deployment processes.

- **README.md**: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview and documentation of the project.

- **development.yaml**: Kubernetes manifest file for deploying the React application in a development environment.

- **docker-compose.yaml**: Defines multi-container Docker applications, useful for local development and testing.

- **main.tf**: The main Terraform configuration file, used for provisioning AKS and other necessary Azure resources.

- **next.config.js**: Configuration file for Next.js, managing settings related to the React application's build and runtime.

- **package-lock.json**: Lock file for npm, ensuring consistent dependency installation across environments.

- **package.json**: Manages the project's dependencies, scripts, and metadata for the React application.

- **react-development.yaml**: Additional Kubernetes configuration specific to the React application's deployment in a development environment.

- **variables.tf**: Defines input variables for the Terraform configuration, allowing customization of infrastructure parameters.

- **yarn.lock**: Lock file for Yarn, ensuring consistent dependency resolution across installations.

## How It Works

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment of the React application, pushing a Docker image to Azure Container Registry and deploying it on AKS.
2. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform scripts in `main.tf` and `modules/ServicePrincipal` provision the necessary Azure infrastructure, including the AKS cluster.
3. **Containerization**: The Dockerfile defines how the React application is containerized, enabling scalable and consistent deployments.

## Getting Started

Follow the setup instructions provided in the individual configuration files and directories to get the CI/CD pipeline running and deploy the React application to AKS.
